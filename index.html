                from a family friend who found her on the streets. She is a calm cat, though she is a little 
                anxious around new people and situations. She lives with my mum in Romania.</p>

                like a dog, as he loves to be taken on walks outside and he barges in rooms without seeming 
                to care. He is a very energetic and extraverted tom-cat. He lives with me and my father in the UK.</p>

                    is hasn't turned ! yet. My father got her a year after he got Bobiță. When he first got her, he kept 
                    her on the second floor of the house, thinking she and Bobiță wouldn't get along. It turns out they 
                    are just fine together, and now it seems like they are best friends! </p>
